# Project Idea: **TheTribe -- Discord Bot**

## Goal

Together with the community, we want to develop a **fully modular
Discord bot** called **"TheTribe"**.\
The goal is to build a **Multi-Guild Multi-Purpose bot** that is easy to
extend and allows multiple developers to collaborate via GitHub.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Features

1.  **Fully Modular System**
    -   Modules can be added or removed independently.
    -   Each developer can work on a module without breaking the rest of
        the code.
    -   Example modules: moderation, music, logging, tickets, games,
        etc.
2.  **Multi-Guild Support**
    -   Every server can have its own configuration.
    -   Settings and data are stored in **MongoDB**.
3.  **Multi-Purpose Functionality**
    -   Not limited to one task but expandable with multiple features.
    -   Examples: utilities, moderation, fun commands, role management,
        automation.
4.  **Frontend (Dashboard)**
    -   Web interface for server admins to configure the bot.
    -   Includes toggles, dropdowns, and forms for module/configuration
        management.
    -   Real-time connection with the backend (API).
5.  **Backend (API)**
    -   REST API or GraphQL for communication between bot and dashboard.
    -   Access to statistics, logs, and module settings.
    -   Authentication via Discord OAuth2 login.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Tech Stack & Tools

-   **Bot:** [discord.js](https://discord.js.org) (Node.js)
-   **Database:** MongoDB (for guild settings, user data, logs, etc.)
-   **Backend:** Express.js (REST API) or NestJS (structured approach)
-   **Frontend:** React or Next.js (with TailwindCSS for fast UI
    development)
-   **Version Control:** GitHub (collaboration, issues, pull requests)
-   **Hosting:** To be decided (e.g., VPS, Docker)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Collaboration

-   Everyone works as a **GitHub collaborator**.
-   Issues and features tracked in GitHub Projects or Kanban board.
-   Modules organized as separate packages or folders for clarity.
-   Agreed code style and linting rules for consistency.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

ðŸ‘‰ The idea is to build **TheTribe** together: a powerful, modular, and
expandable Discord bot with a modern web interface and API backend.
