# GitHub Copilot Prompt for TheTribe

We are building a **modular, multi-guild, multi-purpose Discord bot** called **TheTribe**.
The project should follow these requirements:

- **Discord.js** (Node.js) for the bot core.
- **MongoDB** for storing guild configurations, user data, and logs.
- **Modular structure**: features (moderation, music, logging, tickets, games, etc.) should be built as independent modules that can be easily added/removed.
- **Multi-Guild support**: every server can have its own settings.
- **Frontend (React/Next.js + TailwindCSS)**: dashboard for configuring the bot, with Discord OAuth2 login.
- **Backend (Express.js or NestJS)**: REST API/GraphQL to connect the bot with the dashboard, provide stats, logs, and configuration endpoints.
- **Collaboration**: multiple developers work on GitHub as collaborators. Code should be clean, consistent, and follow agreed linting rules.
- **Scalability**: structure the code in a way that makes it easy to add new features in the future.

ðŸ‘‰ When generating code:
- Write it as modular as possible.
- Provide comments and explanations for complex parts.
- Use modern ES modules (`import`/`export`) instead of CommonJS.
- Add placeholders where additional modules can be connected.

The goal: **A powerful, extensible, community-driven Discord bot with dashboard and API.**
